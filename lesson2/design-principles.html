    <h3><u>White Space and Clean Design</u><br>
    <p>By employing large areas of white space, the page does not feel cramped dispite containing a lot of information. 
    This is further aided by the light background color of many of the headings which extends the white space, rather than encroaching, but still maintains an organized appearance.</p></h3>

    <h3><u>PARC: Alignment</u><br>
    <p>The alternating alignment of the text and other elements helps the page feel more dynamic and creates a sense of motion that conveys the excitement of riding the bike. 
    The alignment style keeps the page from feeling too static, while still creating a theme that makes the page appear well organized.</p></h3>

    <h3><u>PARC: Contrast</u><br>
    <p>Using an image with a background composed of large blocks of neutral colors helps the subject pop, as well as the red logo. 
    Contrast is also employed to good effect by placing white text over the darkest part of the image.</p></h3>
